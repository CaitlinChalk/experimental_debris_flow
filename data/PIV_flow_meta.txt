PIV_flow.mat contains a structure named PIV_flow_out, which is the processed PIV data, with 13 fields:

parameters - contains useful information that applies all data:
	width - width of each flow snapshot in metres
	height - height of flow snapshot in metres
	pix1 - value of one pixel in metres
	y_upper/y-lower - upper and lower y values (metres) for which each flow image could be cropped (not required for analysis)

The remaining 12 fields correspond to 12 specified flow times for which the data have been processed:
t1,t2,t3....t12
Each field contains a subfield run1,run2,run3 - corresponding to the repeated experimental runs.
Within these fields are the following:
t - the actual time in seconds corresponding to the subfield (e.g. for t1, t = 0.035 s)
X - the x coordinates in metres of the grid corresponding to the camera field of view (this is constant for every dataset)
Y - the y coordinates in metres of the grid corresponding to the camera field of view (this is constant for every dataset)
U - the time-averaged horizontal velocity at each grid point for the specified time - cropped to align with the flow free surface 
V - the time-averaged vertical velocity at each grid point for the specified time - cropped to align with the flow free surface 
SD - the standard deviation at that time, after averaging over 30 frames
h - the height of the flow free surface (metres)
jpeg - image file of the flow at time t. View in matlab using imshow(jpeg).
